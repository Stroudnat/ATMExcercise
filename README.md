# ATMExcercise
This was a fun excercise that allowed us excelent practice with React. manipulating the shadow DOM in react to render account details as well as making certian fetures unavailable unless the corrrect info was established to make sure all actions were intentional and meaningful. All you are doing here is entering a certian amount of money for your choosing and taking out a resonable amount before refreshing the page. the app does not allow you to take out more than you have depositd similar to a real ATM machine. I only changed a couple of colors to switch up the UI and make things more readable but i plan on spreading out the UI even more to not have everything so close in proximity. Hopefully I can make this update within the next couple of days and make a better user experience.
